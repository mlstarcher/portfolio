  paragraphOne: `Welcome!  I'm Matthew, a full stack engineer with a passion for bridging the divide between human problems and technological solutions.  I recently led a team of four engineers in prototyping an app that would support small restaurants by making it possible for them to quickly deploy online listings and enable their customers to place and pay for their orders directly.  Currently I'm working as a technical fellow at a coding bootcamp and developing projects to help musicians syncronize remote electronic performances in quarantine.`,
  paragraphTwo: `Prior to becoming a software engineer I spent 12 years working as a tour manager and audio engineer. Adapting ever changing technologies to meet the rigorous standards of world renowned performers taught me to be meticulous and flexible. Working in diverse teams consistently delivering successful outcomes in high pressure situations cemented interpersonal skills that transcend industry.`,
  paragraphThree: `Born in the U.S. I was raised largely in sub-saharan Africa (Kenya, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and just a pinch of France).  I continue to have a passion for travel and culture, including a waistline endangering love of global cuisine. In my spare moments I can often be found studying spanish guitar and trying to convince my dog not to devour whatever raspberry pi project I'm currently tinkering with.`,
